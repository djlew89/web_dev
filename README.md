# web_dev
A repo for a web dev project using MAMP and wordpress.
Remeber to keep CSS files seperate, but in an externaml folder.
Use Lorem Ipsum to fill out sections of text. https://www.lipsum.com/

Purpose / General Guidelines

For your first term project, you will need to create a company website. Don't get hung up on the content of the site, I am more concerned about the layout and functionality. I have provided a link below which will help you generate Lorem Ipsum (pretend text) to fill into the content areas. Feel free to make up your own 'fake company' as well as it's products or services, or simply borrow your content from an existing company website. I have included a video of a sample website I created, to give you an idea of what I'm looking for.

Submission Guidelines

I want the final project to be submitted in the following format:

- Main home/landing page for the site to be named 'index.html' and sit on the 'root' of the site (not within a folder)

- Additional pages to be named 'products.html' or 'services.html' (depending on if your site provides products or services), 'about.html', and 'contact.html'. These 3 pages (as well as any additional pages) are to be located in a folder called 'html'

- For this assignment I want to see the use of 'external CSS'. Your stylesheet(s) are to be located in a folder named 'css'. It is acceptable to have a small amount of internal or inline CSS, only if it makes more sense for specific situations. All page layout and menus should be within an external stylesheet

- Any and all images used on the site should be placed within a folder called 'images'

- When submitting the project, please submit in .zip format. When the .zip file is extracted, I should see the index.html page, and the 3 folders mentioned above (each containing the appropriate files)

Website Layout / Design

- The website should be comprised of the following webpages;

Main Landing page (index.html)
Product and/or Services page
plus 4 additional 'sub-pages' to show:
Product/Service 1
Product/Service 2
Product/Service 3
Product/Service 4
About Us page
plus 4 additional 'sub-pages' to show:
Company History
Team
Careers
News
Contact Us page
- On the Main Landing page as well as the Contact Us page, there should be a horizontal navigation menu along the top of the page, to allow you to navigate around the site (to the home page, product/services page, about us page, and contact us page). This can be either above or below your 'header section'. These pages should contain ONE (or more) separate columns (my example has one column on these pages).

- For the Products and/or Services page and the About Us page there should be both a horizontal navigation menu (explained above) along the top of the page, as well as vertical navigation menu on the left or right side of the page allowing you to navigate to the 'sub pages' under these sections. These pages should contain TWO (or more) separate columns (my example has two columns on these pages), with the vertical navigation menu in one column, and the page content in another.

NOTE: please ensure there are a different number of columns on at least one page, as compared to the rest.

- ALL pages should have a 'header section' which has a company name and/or logo.

- ALL pages should have a 'footer section' which has the name of the person or company (feel free to make something up) who designed the website.

- ALL pages should have a 'content section' which has the main content you are displaying for that specific page.

- For the product/services sub-pages (product 1, product 2, etc..) I would like to see an image on each page, with the image floating to the left or right of the text explaining the product or service

- I would also like to see images on the 'team' page, with the images alternately floating to the left and right for each employee/team member listed (please include at least 2).

- For the 'Contact Us' page, I would like a 'Contact Us form' that MUST have the following inputs:

First Name (required field) (name="var1")
Last Name (required field) (name="var2")
Email Address (required field) (name="var3") 
One Questions that gives you two radio buttons to select the answer (name="var4") 
A drop down selection field that allows you to choose 1 of 4 listed options (name="var5") 
A number field, to enter a number into (name="var6") 
6 checkboxes, allowing the user to check whichever boxes are appropriate (depending on your usage) (name="var7" to "var12") 
A text-area field, allowing for additional comments (name="var13") 
IMPORTANT NOTE:  I will supply you with the .php page to allow us to test your inputs on the 'Contact Us' page, so it is imperative you use exactly the fields I've listed above (unless you want to edit the .php page to add additional inputs, then fill yer boots). The supplied .php page MUST sit in the same folder location as your 'Contact Us' page to work. To make this work as designed use the following start tag for your form:

Start Tag - <form action="form.php" method="get" target="_blank"> 
Also, when setting up your form inputs the "name" attributes MUST be 'var1' thru 'var13' to work with the .php page I've supplied. Again, if you choose to do your own .php for this project, you can, provided it lists the same types of inputs I've asked for.
